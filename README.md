# CartoonOrNot Image Classifiers
## Project Overview
The increasing use of m-banking in Indonesia poses new challenges for financial service providers. One of them is the risk of identity forgery when account registration uses AI-Generated images or even cartoons. Conventional verification systems struggle to distinguish between real and fake images, opening the door to fraud and financial crime.

The project developed a deep learning model to classify cartoon vs. not cartoon images, which is intended to be integrated into an m-banking identity verification system.

## Goals
- Enhance M-Banking Account Security: Detects and prevents the use of cartoon images during account registration, strengthening the security of the identity verification system.
- Minimize the Risk of Fraud: Reduce the risk of opening m-banking accounts with fake identities that can be used for financial crimes.
